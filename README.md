## Project Overview

This project is a modern, responsive movie Browse application, originally developed as a learning exercise in vanilla JavaScript. I've now refactored and rebuilt it using **Next.js** to deepen my understanding of its powerful features and best practices for building robust web applications.

## Live Demo

## Key Features & Technologies Used

* **Next.js:** Leveraging features like (e.g., App Router/Pages Router, Image Optimization with `next/image`, Static Site Generation (SSG) for improved performance on movie listings, Client-Side Data Fetching for search results).
* **TMDB API:** Fetches up-to-date movie information.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
* **Styling:** (e.g., Styled with Tailwind CSS)
* **Deployment:** Seamlessly deployed on Vercel's global Edge Network.

## Why Next.js?

This refactor was a fantastic opportunity to:
* Explore Next.js's routing system and component-based architecture.
* Implement various data fetching strategies.
* Utilize performance optimizations specific to Next.js.
* Gain experience with server-side rendering and static content generation.
